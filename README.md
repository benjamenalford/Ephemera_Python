# Ephemera

##I got tired of having to fiddle with databases for each small project and then there was the problem of not being able to see the stored data without a client. Since almost everything can at least do an HTTP GET / POST, Ephemera API was born to store and view data in MongoDB. The core idea is a general repository for data storage and retrival with no configuration. Every Mongo collection gets is created if it doesn't exist and the views are generated from the data. 

#the installation instructions were written for  Rasbian,  but the I'm hosting on Ubuntu 23 w/ Python , Flask, and Mongo.
